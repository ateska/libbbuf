Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.  

   The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the library and any data files and
     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
     privileges.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

    CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g ./configure --prefix=/opt/
